description: Run OneMCP locally with Docker, interact with the MCP endpoint, and bring your own data.

# Getting Started

Kick the tires in a few minutes using Docker with a mocked server for immediate testing.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (or another OCI container runtime like Podman)
- Internet access to pull the image `admingentoro/gentoro:latest`

## Step 1: Running the Agent

Start OneMCP with the built-in mock server:

```bash
docker run --rm \
	-p 8082:8082 \
	-e APP_ARGS="--process=mock-server --tcp-port=8082" \
	admingentoro/gentoro:latest
```

What to expect in the logs:

- Supervisor starting multiple processes (app, otel, mock server)
- A line indicating the mock server is listening on port 8082
- The Spring app starting and registering the MCP HTTP Stream endpoint at `/mcp`

## Step 2: Interacting with the Agent

The MCP endpoint is exposed over HTTP streaming at:

- MCP URL: `http://localhost:8082/mcp`

Use your MCP-compatible client to connect to the URL above. The server will stream responses and tool calls as defined by the Model Context Protocol.

## Step 3: Using Your Own Data

Mount a local "foundation" folder to override the mocked content (e.g., include `Agent.md`, docs, or OpenAPI specs) at `/var/foundation` inside the container:

```bash
docker run --rm \
	-p 8082:8082 \
	-v "${PWD}:/var/foundation" \
	-e APP_ARGS="--process=mock-server --tcp-port=8082" \
	admingentoro/gentoro:latest
```

Place files like `Agent.md`, Markdown docs, and OpenAPI specs in your current directory before running the command. The agent will index them to ground tool execution.
