# Gentoro OneMCP

OneMCP is an open-source runtime that makes it easy for AI agents to use your API accurately and efficiently.

You provide your API materials — such as the specification, documentation, and authentication details (collectively called the handbook) — and OneMCP immediately exposes your system through a single, natural-language interface.

It removes the need to handcraft MCP tools or connectors while achieving high performance and low token cost through a smart execution-plan system designed for caching and reuse.

## Quick Start


1) First, install the CLI:

Linux or MacOS:

```

Windows:
